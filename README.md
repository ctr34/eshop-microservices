# eshop-microservices

This is a hobby project, to implement a template of back-end of an online shopping mall. The application consists of multiple services, there is a specific feature in each service (such as product management, order management, etc). This product follows microservices architecture, also including some common techs: Kafka, Grafana, docker, k8s and so on.
